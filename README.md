# ssl-cert-server

On the fly free SSL registration and renewal inside [OpenResty/nginx](http://openresty.org) with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org).

This OpenResty plugin automatically and transparently issues SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt as requests are received.

This uses the `ssl_certificate_by_lua` functionality in OpenResty 1.9.7.2+.

By using ssl-cert-server to register SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt, you agree to the [Let's Encrypt Subscriber Agreement](https://letsencrypt.org/repository/).

I got inspires and stolen some code from the awesome project [lua-resty-auto-ssl](https://github.com/GUI/lua-resty-auto-ssl), many thanks ðŸ˜€

## Status

Early development, using in production environment is NOT recommended.

## Configuration Example

```conf
events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
    include       mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    lua_shared_dict ssl_certs_cache 1m;

    init_by_lua_block {
        -- Define a funcction to determine which SNI domains to automatically
        -- handle and register new certificates for. Defaults to not allowing
        -- any domain, so this must be configured.
        function allow_domain(domain)
            return true
        end

        -- Initialize backend certificate server instance.
        cert_server = (require "resty.ssl-cert-server").new({
            backend = '127.0.0.1:8999',
            allow_domain = allow_domain
        })
    }

    # HTTPS Server
    server {
        listen 443 ssl;

        # Works also with non-default HTTPS port.
        listen 8443 ssl;

        server_name example.com;

        # Dynamic handler for issuing or returning certs for SNI domains.
        ssl_certificate_by_lua_block {
            cert_server:ssl_certificate()
        }

        # Fallback certificate required by nginx, self-signed is ok.
        # openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 3650 -nodes -x509 \
        #   -subj '/CN=sni-support-required-for-valid-ssl' \
        #   -keyout /etc/nginx/certs/fallback-self-signed.key \
        #   -out /etc/nginx/certs/fallback-self-signed.crt
        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/fallback-self-signed.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/fallback-self-signed.key;

        location / {
            content_by_lua_block {
                ngx.say("It works!")
            }
        }
    }

    # HTTP Server
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;

        # Endpoint used for performing domain verification with Let's Encrypt.
        location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
            content_by_lua_block {
                cert_server:challenge_server()
            }
        }
    }

}
```

## TODO

1. Implement better cache strategy;
2. Handle backend server failure more robustly;
3. Test case for both cert-server and openresty library.
